## Git Rebase 

Once you have resolved the conflicts and told git how to merge the changes, you need to use the `git add` commands to mark the resolved files and `git rebase --continue` to continue the rebase. 

If you have problems resolving merge conflicts, you can use the `git rebase --abort` command to abort the rebase and return to the state of your repository before the rebase.
